Ingredients:

1 cup basmati rice

2 cups coconut milk

1 cup water

1/4 cup shredded coconut

1 tsp ghee (clarified butter)

1/2 tsp salt

Instructions:

Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.

In a medium pot, combine the coconut milk, water, shredded coconut, ghee, and salt. Bring to a boil.

Add the rice, reduce the heat to low, and cover. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.

Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.
