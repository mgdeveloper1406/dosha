Ingredients:

4 large apples, peeled, cored, and diced

1 tbsp coconut oil

1 small onion, finely chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tbsp grated fresh ginger

1/2 cup apple cider vinegar

1/4 cup raisins

1/4 cup brown sugar or coconut sugar

1 tsp ground cinnamon

1/2 tsp ground cloves

1/2 tsp ground cardamom

1/4 tsp salt

Instructions:

Heat coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Add the chopped onion, garlic, and grated ginger. Saut√© until the onion is soft and translucent.

Add the diced apples, apple cider vinegar, raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and salt. Stir well to combine.

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the apples are soft and the chutney has thickened (about 20-25 minutes).

Remove from heat and let cool. Transfer to a clean jar and refrigerate. The chutney will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

Serve as a condiment with meals, or use as a topping for toast or yogurt.
