Ingredients:

1 large cauliflower, cut into florets

2 tbsp olive oil

1 tsp ground cumin

1 tsp ground coriander

1/2 tsp turmeric powder

1/2 tsp smoked paprika

1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for extra spice)

Salt and pepper to taste

1 lemon, cut into wedges

Fresh cilantro for garnish

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).

In a large bowl, combine olive oil, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Mix well.

Add the cauliflower florets to the bowl and toss until they are evenly coated with the spice mixture.

Spread the cauliflower florets in a single layer on a baking sheet.

Roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender and golden brown, stirring halfway through.

Serve warm, garnished with lemon wedges and fresh cilantro.
